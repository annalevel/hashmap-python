# hashmap-python

Two separate implementations of the hash map data structure written in Python. Includes unit testing.

- `hashmap_oa.py` uses open addressing to handle collisions, built on top of the DynamicArray implementation in `a6_include.py`.
- `hashmap_sc.py` uses separate chaining to handle collisions, built on top of the LinkedList implementation in `a6_include.py`.
